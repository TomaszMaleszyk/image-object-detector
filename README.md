## Digital image object detector

This application was made on my master’s defence on Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski. 
It main goal is detecting objects chosen by user. 
On detecting objects consist a few levels. Every of this levels represent operation which I implemented in this application:

•	digital image acquisition,

•	improvement quality of digital image,

•	localisation of potential occurrence object,

•	extraction and classification feature of object,

•	decision process on recognition operation.

It’s desktop application realized in C# and Matlab language.

⇒ Visual Studio 2015, .NET 4.5, Windows Forms, Matlab R2015a, Matlab Runtime 8.5
